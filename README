I have simply hacked it to work with the RaspberryPi, using the in-kernel
I2C drivers.  It should be trival to make use of any of the other sensors
Jeff supports in this way.

'make' will create three demos:


piMotor.cpp - displays raw gyro and accel values and run Brushless DC motor for controlling


For Motor controlling I used pigpio library http://abyz.co.uk/rpi/pigpio/ 
This library provide us to controlling motor real time.


I get acc/gyro data from MPU6050 and send data from Rasperry Pi to My copmputer and visualized a ~realtime
